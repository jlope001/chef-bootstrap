# Bootstrap System
Whenever installing a new linux desktop, I always find myself installing the same pieces of software over, and over again.

My first stab at automating this was a bash script.  It quickly became too complicated.  Enter chef-solo

## Setup
In order to bootstrap the system, you will need to install some pieces of software.

What we will install is RVM, chef, berkshelf.

```
$ make setup
```

### Software Installed
* rvm
* chef
* berkshelf

### Post Setup
If you are planning to install right after the setup command, you will need to source RVM from your current terminal with:

```
echo "source $HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" >> ~/.bashrc
```

## Installation
Once the requirements have been met, simply run the install command.

```
$ make install
```

### Software Installed
Below is a list of all software installed during the chef run.
